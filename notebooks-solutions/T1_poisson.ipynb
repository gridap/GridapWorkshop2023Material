Neumann boundary conditions are applied on $\\Gamma_{\\rm N} = \\{ z = 0 \\} \\cup \\{ z = 1 \\}$, i.e the bottom and top boundaries. Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied everywhere else, i.e $\\Gamma_{\\rm D} = \\{ x = -\\pi \\} \\cup \\{ x = \\pi \\} \\cup \\{ y = -\\pi/2 \\} \\cup \\{ y = \\pi/2 \\}$.\n",

    " To solve this PDE, we use a conventional Galerkin finite element (FE) method with conforming Lagrangian FE spaces (see, e.g., [1] for specific details on this formulation). The weak form associated with this formulation is: find $u\\in U$ such that $ a(u,v) = l(v) $ for all $v\\in V$, where $U$ and $V$ are the subset of functions in $H^1(\\Omega)$ that fulfill the Dirichlet boundary condition $g$ and $0$ respectively.

    "The problem is solved numerically by approximating the spaces $U$ and $V$ by their discrete counterparts associated with a FE mesh of the computational domain $\\Omega$. As we have anticipated, we consider standard conforming Lagrangian FE spaces for this purpose.\n",
