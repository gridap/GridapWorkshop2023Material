In particular, we will used a particular Gridap's `DiscreteModel` that efficiently supports *dynamic* $h$-adaptivity techniques (a.k.a. AMR), i.e., the ability of the mesh to be refined *in the course of the simulation* in those regions of the domain that present a complex behaviour (e.g., the internal layer in the case of our problem at hand), and to be coarsened in those areas where essentially nothing relevant happens (e.g., those areas away from the internal layer)."

    "In order to support AMR techniques, `GridapP4est.jl` relies on the so-called forest-of-trees approach for efficient mesh generation and adaptation as provided by the `p4est` library [2]. Forest-of-trees can be seen as a two-level decomposition of $\\Omega$, referred to as macro and micro level, resp. In the macro level, we have the so-called coarse mesh, i.e., a *conforming* partition $\\mathcal{C}_h$ of $\\Omega$. For efficiency reasons, $\\mathcal{C}_h$ should be as coarse as possible, but it should also keep the geometrical discretization error within tolerable margins. For complex domains, $\\mathcal{C}_h$ is usually generated by an unstructured mesh generator, and then imported into the program using, e.g., using `GridapGmsh`. For simple domains, such as boxes, a single coarse cell is sufficient to resolve the geometry of $\\Omega$. On the other hand, in the micro level, each of the cells of $\\mathcal{C}_h$ becomes the root of an adaptive tree that can be subdivided arbitrarily (i.e., recursively refined) into finer cells."

    "Tree-based meshes provide multi-resolution capability by local adaptation. The cells in the mesh (i.e., the leaves of the adaptive trees) might be located at different refinement level.  However, these meshes are (potentially)  *non-conforming*, i.e., they contain the so-called *hanging* vertices, edges, and faces.  These occur at the interface of neighboring cells with different refinement levels. Mesh non-conformity introduces additional complexity in the implementation of conforming finite element formulations [3].  Despite the aforementioned, we note the following. First, the degree of implementation complexity is significantly reduced by enforcing the so-called *2:1 balance* constraint, i.e., adjacent cells may differ at most by a single level of refinement; the $h$-adaptive triangulation in `GridapP4est.jl` always satisfies this constraint. Second, `Gridap` is written such that it is entirely responsible for handling such complexity. As demonstrated in this tutorial, library users are not aware of mesh non-conformity when coding the weak form of the finite element formulation at hand."

(The same requirement applies to the rest of data structures in the finite element simulation pipeline, i.e., finite element space, linear system, solver, etc.) Besides, as the solution might exhibit highly localized features, dynamic mesh adaptation can result in an unacceptable amount of load imbalance. Thus, it urges that the adaptive mesh data structure supports *dynamic load-balancing*, i.e., that it can be re-distributed among the parallel processes in the course of the simulation."

    "Modern forest-of-trees manipulation engines, such as `p4est`, provide a scalable, linear runtime solution to the mesh (re-)partitioning problem based on the exploitation of Space-Filling-Curves (SFCs). SFCs provide a natural means to assign an ordering of the forest-of-trees leaves, which is exploited for the parallel arrangement of data. For example, in `GridapP4est.jl`, the forest-of-octrees leaves are arranged in a global one-dimensional data array in increasing Morton index ordering. This ordering corresponds geometrically with the traversal of a $z$-shaped SFC (a.k.a. Morton SFC). This approach allows for *fast dynamic repartitioning*. A partition of the mesh is simply generated by dividing the leaves in the linear ordering induced by the SFCs into as many equally-sized segments as parallel tasks involved in the computation."

The local portion of each task is composed by a set of cells that it owns, i.e., the *local cells* of the task, and a set of off-processor cells (owned by remote processors) which are in touch with its local cells, i.e., the *ghost cells* of the task. This overlapped mesh partition is used by the library to exchange data among nearest neighbours, and to glue together the global degrees-of-freedom of the finite element space which are sitting on the interface among subdomains, as required in order to construct finite element spaces for conforming finite element formulations in a distributed setting."

    "The `amr_loop` function re-uses the previously defined functions along with functionality available in `GridapP4est.jl` to implement the 6 steps enumerated above. The `FixedFractionAdaptiveFlagsMarkingStrategy` constructor creates a Julia object which conceptually represents the strategy in step 3. Combining this object with the cell-wise error indicators $e_K$, the `update_adaptivity_flags!` function determines which cells to be refined, which to coarsen, and which to leave as they were prior to adaptation (as per described in step 3.). Finally, the `adapt` function adapts the mesh using the flags, and the `redistribute` function dynamically balances the load among the MPI tasks to correct for the imbalances caused by mesh adaptation."

These objects are referenced by a place holder variable named  `_` which is not further used in the function. We note, however, that these objects encode relevant information that allows one to describe how the original and the transformed models are related. This is particularly necessary when dealing with transient and/or non-linear problems, where one has to transfer data (e.g., finite element functions) among meshes. For simplicity, this feature is not illustrated in the tutorial."
