# ## Problem statement
#
# We want to solve a linear elasticity problem defined on the 3D domain depicted in next figure.
#
# ![](../figures/elasticity/solid.png)
#
# We impose the following boundary conditions. All components of the displacement vector are constrained to zero on the surface $\Gamma_{\rm G}$, which is marked in green in the figure. On the other hand, the first component of the displacement vector is prescribed to the value $\delta\doteq 5$mm on the surface $\Gamma_{\rm B}$, which is marked in blue. No body or surface forces are included in this example. Formally, the PDE to solve is
#
# $$
# \left\lbrace
# \begin{aligned}
# -∇\cdot\sigma(u) = 0 \ &\text{ in } \ \Omega,\\
# u = 0 \ &\text{ on }\ \Gamma_{\rm G},\\
# u_1 = \delta \ &\text{ on }\ \Gamma_{\rm B},\\
# n \cdot \sigma(u)  = 0 \ &\text{ on }\  \Gamma_{\rm N}.\\
# \end{aligned}
# \right.
# $$
#
# The variable $u$ stands for the unknown displacement vector, the vector $n$ is the unit outward normal to the Neumann boundary $\Gamma_{\rm N}\doteq\partial\Omega\setminus\left(\Gamma_{\rm B}\cup\Gamma_{\rm G}\right)$ and $\sigma(u)$ is the stress tensor defined as
# $$
# \sigma(u) \doteq \lambda\ {\rm tr}(\varepsilon(u)) \ I +2 \mu \  \varepsilon(u),
# $$
# where $I$ is the 2nd order identity tensor, and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the *Lamé parameters* of the material. The operator $\varepsilon(u)\doteq\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T \right)$ is the symmetric gradient operator (i.e., the strain tensor). Here, we consider material parameters corresponding to aluminum with Young's modulus $E=70\cdot 10^9$ Pa and Poisson's ratio $\nu=0.33$. From these values, the Lamé parameters are obtained as $\lambda = (E\nu)/((1+\nu)(1-2\nu))$ and $\mu=E/(2(1+\nu))$.
#
# ## Numerical scheme
#
# We use a conventional Galerkin FE method with conforming Lagrangian FE spaces. For this formulation, the weak form is: find $u\in U$ such that $ a(u,v) = 0 $ for all $v\in V_0$, where $U$ is the subset of functions in $V\doteq[H^1(\Omega)]^3$ that fulfill the Dirichlet boundary conditions of the problem, whereas $V_0$ are functions in $V$ fulfilling $v=0$ on $\Gamma_{\rm G}$ and $v_1=0$ on $\Gamma_{\rm B}$. The bilinear form of the problem is
# $$
# a(u,v)\doteq \int_{\Omega} \varepsilon(v) : \sigma(u) \ {\rm d}\Omega.
# $$
#
# ## Load and inspect the discrete model
#
# On top of it's mesh-generation functionalities, Gridap provides a convenient ways to read and write discrete models from and to files. We import the model for this problem from `GMSH` as follows:

using Gridap, GridapGmsh
using Gridap.Io
using DrWatson

msh_file_gmsh = projectdir("meshes/elasticity.msh")
model = GmshDiscreteModel(msh_file_gmsh)

# This model contains the mesh and the physical tags of the model, which have been created directly through `GMSH`. Another option would be to create the model using Gridap, then exporting to `.json` format in the following way: 

msh_file_json = projectdir("meshes/elasticity.json")
to_json_file(model,msh_file_json)

# We can then load the saved model

model = DiscreteModelFromFile(msh_file_json)

# You can easily inspect the generated discrete model in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) by writing it in `vtk` format.

writevtk(model,datadir("elasticity_model"))

# The previous line generates four different files `model_0.vtu`, `model_1.vtu`, `model_2.vtu`, and `model_3.vtu` containing the vertices, edges, faces, and cells present in the discrete model. Moreover, you can easily inspect which boundaries are defined within the model.

# ### Exercise 1
#
# _Open the resulting files with ParaView. Visualize the faces of the model and color them by each of the available fields. Identify the field names representing the boundaries $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm G}$._

# ## Set up the vector-valued FE space with Dirichlet BCs in selected components
#
# We will construct the vector-valued test FE space as follows:
#
# ```julia
# order = 1
# reffe = ReferenceFE(lagrangian,VectorValue{3,Float64},order)
# V0 = TestFESpace(model,reffe;
#  conformity=:H1,
#  dirichlet_tags=dirichlet_tags,
#  dirichlet_masks=dirichlet_masks)
# ```
#
# The vector-valued interpolation is selected via the option `valuetype=VectorValue{3,Float64}`, where we use the type `VectorValue{3,Float64}`, which is the way Gridap represents vectors of three `Float64` components.
#
# In the next two exercises, we will fill in
#   1. the `dirichlet_tags` optional argument to identify the Dirichlet regions, and
#   2. the `dirichlet_masks` optional argument to specify which components of the displacement are constrained.
#
# Let's go step-by-step.
#
# ### Exercise 2
#
# _Fill in the `dirichlet_tags` using the tag names identified in **Exercise 2** for $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm G}$._
#
#hint= **Hint:** The general input format of `dirichlet_tags` is a one-dimensional array of tag name strings `["tag_name_1",...,"tag_name_n"]`.

#hint=# Solution for exercise 2
#sol=dirichlet_tags = ["surface_1","surface_2"]

# ### Exercise 3
#
# _Fill in the `dirichlet_masks` to select the displacement components to constrain._
#
#hint= **Hint:** The general input format of `dirichlet_masks` is a one-dimensional array with the same length and order as `dirichlet_tags`. Each entry of `dirichlet_masks` is a boolean tuple of length the problem dimension `D`, i.e. `(bool_x1,...,bool_xD)`. If `bool_xi == true`, then the `xi` component of the displacement is constrained, otherwise it is free. Beware of passing the `dirichlet_masks` in the same order as the `dirichlet_tags`.
#
# Recall that we constrain only the first component on the boundary $\Gamma_{\rm B}$, whereas we constrain all components on $\Gamma_{\rm G}$.

#hint=# Solution for exercise 3
#sol=dirichlet_masks=[(true,false,false), (true,true,true)]

# We can now instantiate the vector-valued test FE space.

order = 1
reffe = ReferenceFE(lagrangian,VectorValue{3,Float64},order)
V0    = TestFESpace(model,reffe;
                    conformity=:H1,
                    dirichlet_tags=dirichlet_tags,
                    dirichlet_masks=dirichlet_masks)

# Next, we construct the trial FE space. The Dirichlet boundary conditions must be described with two different functions, one for boundary $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ and another one for $\Gamma_{\rm G}$.
#
# ### Exercise 4
#
# _Define the Dirichlet functions according to the problem statement._
#
#hint= **Hint:** The functions must be vector-valued with the format `VectorValue(val_x1,...,val_xD)`.

#hint=# Solution for exercise 4
#sol=g1(x) = VectorValue(0.005,0.0,0.0)
#sol=g2(x) = VectorValue(0.0,0.0,0.0)

# ### Exercise 5
#
# _Define the trial FE space `U`._
#
#hint= **Hint:** Pass the Dirichlet functions in a one-dimensional array, in the same order as `dirichlet_tags` and `dirichlet_masks`.

#hint=# Solution for exercise 5
#sol=U = TrialFESpace(V0,[g1,g2])

# We will now visually check the Dirichlet values are being correctly assigned on the Dirichlet boundaries.
#
# ### Exercise 6
#
# _Create a `BoundaryTriangulation` of the Dirichlet boundaries._

#hint=# Solution for exercise 6
#sol=Γ = BoundaryTriangulation(model,tags=dirichlet_tags)

# Next, we create a FE Function of `U` with zero-valued free values.

vh = zero(U)

# ### Exercise 7
#
# _Plot `vh` on the Dirichlet boundaries using `writevtk`_

#hint=# Solution for exercise 7
#sol=writevtk(Γ,"check-trial-fe-space",cellfields=["vh"=>vh])

# The plot of the x-component of `vh` should look as follows.
#
# ![](../figures/elasticity/fig_dbc.png)
#
# _Why do the results at the contour of $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ look weird?_
#
# The reason is because we are enforcing the Dirichlet values _only in the interior_ of the Dirichlet regions. So, in the contour of $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ the x-component of the DoF values must be zero. We can use the tag names of the model ending with `_c` to enforce the Dirichlet conditions on the boundary closure too.
#
# ## From weak form to visualising the Solution
#
# ### Exercise 8
#
# _Read the details about how we define weak form, solve the problem and visualise the results._
#
# The construction of the weak form needs to account for the constitutive law that relates strain and stress. The symmetric gradient operator is represented by the function `ε` provided by Gridap (also available as `symmetric_gradient`). However, function `σ` representing the stress tensor is not predefined in the library and it has to be defined ad-hoc by the user, namely

const E = 70.0e9
const ν = 0.33
const λ = (E*ν)/((1+ν)*(1-2*ν))
const μ = E/(2*(1+ν))
σ(ε) = λ*tr(ε)*one(ε) + 2*μ*ε

# Function `σ` takes a strain tensor `ε` (one can interpret this strain as the strain at an arbitrary integration point) and computes the associated stress tensor using the Lamé operator.
#
# We build now the integration mesh and the corresponding measure

degree = 2*order
Ω      = Triangulation(model)
dΩ     = Measure(Ω,degree)

# From these objects and the constitutive law previously defined, we can write the weak form as follows

a(u,v) = ∫( (σ∘ε(u)) ⊙ ε(v) )dΩ
l(v)   = 0

# Note that we have composed function `σ` with the strain field `ε(u)` in order to compute the stress field associated with the trial function `u`. The linear form is simply `l(v) = 0` since there are not external forces in this example.
#
# The remaining steps for solving the FE problem are rather standard.

op = AffineFEOperator(a,l,U,V0)
uh = solve(op)

# Finally, we write the results to a file. Note that we also include the strain and stress tensors into the results file.

out_file = datadir("elasticity_sol")
writevtk(Ω,out_file,cellfields=["uh"=>uh,"epsi"=>ε(uh),"sigma"=>σ∘ε(uh)])

# If you plot the deformed displacement in ParaView, it can be clearly observed (see next figure) that the surface $\Gamma_{\rm B}$ is pulled in $x_1$-direction and that the solid deforms accordingly.
